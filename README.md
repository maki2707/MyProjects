## 1.NutPlan

The developed mobile application offers the possibility of managing your own recipes, 
planning your diet, keeping records of available groceries and creating a list for the store. 

The mobile application was developed using the React Native JavaScript framework and is 
intended for use on devices with the Android operating system. Google's NOSQL Cloud 
Firestore Database solution was used for the database.
